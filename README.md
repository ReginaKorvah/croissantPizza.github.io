# pizzaOrderForm
This pizza order form uses HTML and CSS to take a customer's order and submit the order for processing. This is a simplified version of what major pizza corporations have to do in order to take and process orders in the field of pizza making. This is my take on such websites in the form of a new restaurant called "Croissant Pizza".
